RecycleMeter: A Custom IoT Device for Real-Time Waste Management and Data Analytics

Cultural events are significant to a community, as they provide an opportunity to promote heritage, and diversity, and strengthen community cohesion. While they offer attendees a memorable experience, they tend to generate serious environmental impacts, such as large amounts of waste, high energy consumption, and transportation-related CO2 emissions. Unlike large-scale festivals, small and midsize non-profit festivals often don't practice sustainability initiatives, due to limited budgets, staff, and awareness. The Japan Festival Boston was also one of them since its start in 2012, where no sustainability efforts such as waste separation have been conducted.
