RecycleMeter: A Custom IoT Device for Real-Time Waste Management and Data Analytics

Background: Cultural events are significant to a community, as they provide an opportunity to promote heritage, and diversity, and strengthen community cohesion. While they offer attendees a memorable experience, they tend to generate serious environmental impacts, such as large amounts of waste, high energy consumption, and transportation-related CO2 emissions. Unlike large-scale festivals, small and midsize non-profit festivals often don't practice sustainability initiatives, due to limited budgets, staff, and awareness. The Japan Festival Boston was also one of them since its start in 2012, where no sustainability efforts such as waste separation have been conducted.

Objective: To address one of these challenges, we developed “RecycleMeter,” an innovative IoT device that visualizes visitors’ waste sorting contributions in real time. RecycleMeter promotes recycling through proper waste separation, incentivizes environmentally-conscious disposal behavior, and arms organizers with actionable data to refine waste management strategies. By combining technology with education, the project raises sustainability awareness, reduces landfill waste, and embodies the Japanese cultural philosophy of “mottainai,” emphasizing resource mindfulness.

Methodology: To develop this smart waste tracking system, we assembled a load cell kit and added a Python code to allow users to select the waste category and automatically calculate the estimated number of collected chopsticks and the reduction in CO2 emissions equivalent from the weight to an open-source driver on GitHub to read the weight. Festival visitors can instantly view their recycling contributions on the website, fostering a sense of involvement and promoting behavioral change. Additionally, organizers gain actionable waste management data to drive future improvements.

Conclusion: During the 2025 Japan Festival Boston, RecycleMeter-enabled waste management yielded remarkable outcomes: 150.01 kg of waste was properly sorted over two days, significantly reducing landfill loads. Notably, 56.44 kg (estimated 19,936 pieces) of disposable chopsticks were collected for upcycling, storing 29.24 kg of CO₂ equivalent. Another 93.57 kg of recyclables were responsibly separated. By showcasing numerical “visibility” of environmental contributions, the project merged technology, sustainability, and the Japanese concept of “mottainai,” turning cultural events into platforms for environmental education, proactive behavior, and actionable insights for organizers. The success of RecycleMeter underscores its transformative potential in fostering sustainability in public festivals.
